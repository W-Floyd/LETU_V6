# LETU V6

The LETU V6 was the 2018 Freshman 3D printer at LeTourneau University, the year in which I built one.
Student designed, it is a sturdy workhorse than continues to serve me well.
Over time, I have upgraded a few things on the printer, and really ought to do more.

Included in this repository are the STL files for printed hardware, and the provided Marlin v1.1.9 firmware.
While the firmware was provided to students, I am not aware that the STL files were.
These were provided to me by a TA that year.

Additionally, I will provide any additional resources I create or collect from fellow students.
